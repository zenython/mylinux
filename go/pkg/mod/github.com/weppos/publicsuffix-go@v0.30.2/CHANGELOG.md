## 0.2.0

- CHANGED: Definition updates.

- ENHANCEMENT: List.Select() is no longer exported. This was an experimental method and it's now kept private as the Find() implementation may change in the future.

- ENHANCEMENT: List.Find() now returns a pointer to a Rule, and not a Rule. That's because Find() can actually return `nil` if the DefaultRule find option is set. This is useful if you need to avoid the fallback to the default rule "*".
