type Level int

// The level numbers below don't really matter too much. Any system can map them
// to another numbering scheme if it wishes. We picked them to satisfy three
// constraints.
//
// First, we wanted the default level to be Info, Since Levels are ints, Info is
// the default value for int, zero.
//
// Second, we wanted to make it easy to work with verbosities instead of levels.
// Verbosities start at 0 corresponding to Info, and larger values are less severe
// Negating a verbosity converts it into a Level.
//
// Third, we wanted some room between levels to accommodate schemes with named
// levels between ours. For example, Google Cloud Logging defines a Notice level
// between Info and Warn. Since there are only a few of these intermediate
// levels, the gap between the numbers need not be large. Our gap of 4 matches
// OpenTelemetry's mapping. Subtracting 9 from an OpenTelemetry level in the
// DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR ranges converts it to the corresponding slog
// Level range. OpenTelemetry also has the names TRACE and FATAL, which slog
// does not. But those OpenTelemetry levels can still be represented as slog
// Levels by using the appropriate integers.
//
// Names for common levels.
